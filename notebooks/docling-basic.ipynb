      "\n",
      "To keep it simple, a meal is made up of 3 different components or food groups as we usually call them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Protein\n",
      "2. Grain\n",
      "3. Produce (vegetables/fruits)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these different food groups have great health benefits on their own. Protein is a great source of energy, is satiating, and helps to build and rebuild muscles. Grains are the main source of fuel for our body and brain. Vegetables and fruits are full of fiber and important vitamins and minerals. When each component is combined together in a meal, the nutrition benefits increase even more. An easy way to make sure that you are getting a protein, grain, and produce item in each meal is to use the Plate Method. Mentally divide your plate into three parts when planning or preparing a meal and then fill each part with one of the three meal components. Using this method can help you achieve balance, variety, and nutrition with each meal.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Cut all the vegetables that need to be cut and set aside in small bowls or on plates.\n",

      "3. Add zucchini and red pepper and sauté for 8-10 minutes. The vegetables should be softened but not mushy and just starting to brown.\n",

This is where the filling will go so make it wide enough, but don't cut through the bottom of the apples.\n",
      "2. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, dried fruit, and pecans. Place the apples in a square baking dish (8x8 or 9x9 both work well). Stuff each apple with the filling mixture and top each with a dot of butter (about 1 tsp for each).\n",
      "3. Add boiling water or apple juice to the baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the apples are tender, but not mushy. Remove the dish from the over and baste the apples with the pan juices several times. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or vanilla yogurt if desired.\n",

      "\n",
      "This recipe book is a very basic start to giving you some resources to help you feel confident in preparing healthy, homemade meals from your apartment or home. Of course, this does not even begin to scratch the surface of all the healthy recipes that are available. So where can you go for more ideas if you can't find something you're looking for here? Try some of the following resources:\n",
      "\n",
      "-  Pinterest : Just type in whatever you are thinking about making and you will find dozens to thousands of recipe ideas. This is also a great way to find food blogs or other recipe websites. You can even type in key words like 'healthy', 'college-friendly', 'vegetarian' to recipes that fall into that category.\n",
      "-  Allrecipes.com : This is another website similar to Pinterest, but it is only for recipes. It's a great community based website and most recipes have ideas for how to adapt them or adjust them. Recipes are also given reviews so you can search for recipes that are 4 or 5 stars and know that you are likely going to end up with a really good recipe.\n",
      "-  Budgetbytes.com : Budget Bytes is a website full of recipes created for people on a budget-hence most college students! Beyond having a wide variety of recipes, the author includes how much each recipe costs. The website also offers some additional resources including how-to tutorials, tips on what cooking utensils and equipment you should own, and more.\n",
      "-  Local Library : Going to the library isn't as simple as looking up a recipe on your phone. However, there is just something fun about reading through and cooking from an actual cookbook and the library is the perfect place to find some great ones.\n",
      "-  Family/Friends : Ask family or friends for their favorite recipes, especially if you know that they make really good food. Beyond getting some great recipes, you might also learn some new tips and tricks that you can use as you expand your cooking skills.\n",
      "-  USU Wellness and Nutrition Website : Visit health.usu.edu for additional resources on wellness and nutrition. You can also visit with the on-campus dietitian if you have additional nutrition-related concerns or questions that you would like help with.\n"
